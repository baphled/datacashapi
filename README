DataCash Api

Used to interact with DataCash.

As DataCash's current API does not conform to PHP5 standards & uses
globals along with references, there is a need to create an API
that can be used with ZendFramework and other frameworks.

This API uses Zend_PHPUnit_Fixtures to help support the testing
of this API, so PHP5, PHPUnit3.4 will be needed to use & test its
functionality.
